# LOLcat Clock Project

The LOLcat Clock Skillcrush project is based on the popular LOLcat memes. (More info about LOLcat here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcat)

## Objective

Use vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation to create a clock that features:

* The current time.
* Images that change depending on the time of day, with corresponding greetings (i.e., "Good Afternoon" in the afternoon).
* Three different timers for wake-up time, lunch time, and nap time.
* Images that change when each of the timers go off.
* A "Party Time" button that changes color when clicked, and also changes the image.
